            <p> Hi! I am Joshua, a software developer and tech enthusiast.
                I have always been fascinated with the ability to create and
                build things from my imagination. Software development has 
                been an outlet for this creative instinct. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa but have since lived
                many places ranging from Alaska to Brazil. I claim many hobbies
                as my own: lifting, mountain biking, fishing, snowboarding, 
                painting, reading, and obviously tech. Most of all, I enjoy learning!
            </p>
            <p>
                I created VoyageVaults as a place to display and document my 
                projects and abilities. Please feel free to look around and reach 
                out if you are looking for a front-end engineer.
